# Examples
# Data could be used to calculate the life expectancy at birth e0, using all values of nLx and the radix.  
sum(nLx)/radix

# The same mortality data could be used to calculate the number of years a newborn is expecting lo live while in the reproductive ages, i.e., between 15 and 50, dividing the total number of person-years years lived between 15 and 50 by the radix.
# (T15 - T50)/l0
(sum(nLx[x >= 15]) - sum(nLx[x >= 50]))/radix
# alternatively,
sum(nLx[x >= 15 & x < 50])/radix
# which is the same as:
sum(nLx[rEP])/radix

# Exercise 1: Fertility and reproduction question (Compulsory)
# Calculate the following values and comment on your results.
# a. Crude Birth Rate.

# Hint: use the variable "rEP" to identify observations related to reproductive ages.

# Exercise 3: Fertility and reproduction question (Optional)
# Estimate the TFR and NRR for all available years, and address the following questions.
# In which year after World War II did fertility first fall below replacement level? Between 1933 and 1941, the Total Fertility Rate exceeded two children per woman, yet the net reproduction rate remained below replacement. What accounts for this discrepancy?
# Hint: Use a loop to consolidate the nLx and nFx matrices. Estimate all years simultaneously using a single line of code.
